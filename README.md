## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was built using using CSS classes to flip the cards. Each time a card is flipped it's pushed to an array to compare them, when matching a class is added to keep them face up. The end of the game is marked by a global counter that ends it when all 10 cards have been matched. 


## Lessons Learned:

I got alot of repetition in with using arrays and classes in programming. They're so flexible and it's still surprising to see how much you can change the game with them.
